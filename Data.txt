Data: 

On GitHub  you have the data for the task 1B ("test.csv" and "train.csv")

But no for the Task 3B (One of them is to huge to be on GitHub):

CNIL.csv is already on GitHub (you can find it here : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/correspondants-informatique-et-libertes-cil/

And you need this one:

Call it "SIREN.csv" before run the code :http://files.data.gouv.fr/sirene/sirene_201710_L_M.zip


Moreover we don't use "SIREN.csv" on the RMardkwon to spend less time to  compile, so find "DataStep3.csv" for the step3.
